      <h1><u>Poem of the Month</u></h1><br>
      <p class=week> <br>
      <br>

      Love, pain, betrayal, and heartache<br>
Just a few things that keep me awake<br>
The thought that I'm losing all my fights<br>
Is the very thing that keeps me up at night<br>
No it's not the fact that I experienced pain<br>
It's the fact that I feel like I didn't gain<br>
It's not the fact that I fell in love again<br>
It's the thought that I'm so broken that this love will also soon end<br>
It's not the many times that I've experienced heartache<br>
It's that I didn't expect to see trusted faces that caused my heart to break<br>
And yeah we all experience betrayal at some point in time<br>
But how do I stop it from constantly replaying in my mind?<br>
I tell myself to keep going<br>
I try to keep the pain from showing<br>
But when the weight of the world is on your shoulders<br>
No one can tell you that it's not over<br>
Because when the only thing that makes you smile<br>
Is the pure and innocence pouring into you from your child<br>
It builds you up so high then tears you down<br>
Man I hate that they want to see me smile but understand why I frown<br>
I hate crying when they're around<br>
I hate that they are the ones fixing my crooked crown<br>
I hate that I'm so unsure of myself<br>
Yet I'm always finding someone else's self wealth <br>
I keep telling myself to close up shop an step away from the world<br>
But Yanee don't want y'all to forget about your girl<br>
So I pour my heart out into these words and write another day<br>
Hoping that one day these words will take the pain away<br>
<br>
