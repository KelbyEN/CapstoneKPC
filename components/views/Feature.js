      Title:Black Man<br>
      <br>


I see you Black Man,<br>
all on the internet shaming women, I see you black man<br>
in every picture throwing gang signs, I see you Black Man,<br>
all in the streets killing each other, I see you Black Man,<br>
leaving your kids to fend for themselves, I see you black man<br>
Oh you to good to work, I see you black man<br>
we might as well kill you so we don’t see you black man,<br>
No, you want to kill me because you are afraid of this black man,<br>
all on the internet loving our black women as a black man,<br>
in every picture with our degrees as a black man,<br>
all in the streets rebuilding our community as a black man,<br>
showing up for our kids and cheering them on as a black man,<br>
taking over corporate America and having our businesses as a black man,<br>
you are afraid of that black man so u try to paint a negative picture for the world to see of a black man,<br>
we built this country and youre afraid of my power as a black man,<br>
everybody loves us and our culture so you envy the black man,<br>
to my black men—protect our women and keep raising our kids as a black man,<br>
walk tall and head high as a proud black man,<br>
Because theres no greater feeling than being a beautiful Black Man<br>
