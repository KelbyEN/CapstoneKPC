      <h1><u>Poem of the Month</u></h1>
      <p class=week> Title: How you better than me? <br>
      <br>

Talking to you I get jealous <br>
Your meekness maybe<br>
Or how curiosity never<br>
Killed your cat<br>
See I was born in this<br>
Still don’t understand this<br>
Prolly never get this<br>
But you<br>
Something bout you different -<br>
my brother wait<br>
<br>
<br>
Dont say that<br>
For you it’s not late<br>
One thing you say it was<br>
Think about this<br>
Who got the message first though<br>
it was you<br>
Who has the power to control it in themself<br>
It’s you<br>
So what you doin with it ain’t on me<br>
It’s on you<br>
Jealousy is a sin<br>
Sin Jehovah hates<br>
You startin to act like Cain<br>
Before you fall my brother wait <br>
<br>
<br>

Man shut up<br>
Don’t know my story<br>
Nor my pain<br>
So don’t start judging<br>
Talking bout acting like Cain<br>
So you Abel right<br>
You over righteous piece of shit<br>
Who are you<br>
Telling me that’s on me<br>
But tell me<br>
Sitting in a room full of men<br>
Talking all that knowledge<br>
Them niggas that went to colleges<br>
Tell me if you was me<br>
What you gone believe<br>
With the knowledge of only one thing<br>
In knowledge I believe<br>
Is some super power shit<br>
That’s your only one up on me<br>
Versatility and shit - <br>
<br>
<br>
My brother wait<br>
You don’t need anything<br>
Except the truth<br>
You got the book<br>
You got the map<br>
You got the key<br>
Got the people<br>
Got his hand<br>
Enough support you<br>
What else you need<br>
Don’t listen to nobody but the one up above<br>
Everybody else<br>
Works against you<br>
Don’t wanna see you succeed<br>
Wanna hurt you<br>
Pay attention to me<br>
Have you ever read<br>
1 Corinthians 15:33<br>
I Don’t think so<br>
open up your Bible<br>
My brother can you read - <br>
<br>
<br>
Listen here I was baptized off that scripture<br>
I know it word from word<br>
What you tryna test me<br>
Jesus even loved criminals<br>
Nigga fuck you<br>
You don’t know nothing<br>
Just as much as you think it’s good<br>
It’s bad in that shit they ain’t perfect either<br>
They hurt you worse<br>
You’d think they’d be better<br>
But I’ve been hurt the worst<br>
By the people<br>
And they say they living that shit<br>
You think you safe huh<br>
I can tell by the look on ya face,<br>
Watch your back nigga<br>
They got knives too<br>
They move slick with the shit<br>
Think you with your friends<br>
Until they stab you in ya back<br>
Rip your heart out<br>
Drink your blood and suck your soul<br>
Devour your body then suck the bone<br>
As they watch you bleed out and shit<br>
Swear you wouldn’t think it’s<br>
So cold<br>
So heartless<br>
Worst part is<br>
It be your closest<br>
So you don’t say I "didn’t warn you"<br>
Imma only say it one time my nigga<br>
Don’t lose your focus<br>
Since you think you better than me - <br>
<br>
<br>
My brother wait<br>
Yes they’re imperfect<br>
Just like you say I’m over righteous<br>
Look at you<br>
You got a rafter<br>
Yes they got twigs<br>
Seems the only thing you captured<br>
Feel the love<br>
See the family<br>
Feel his hand<br>
let him mold you<br>
Don’t be like Peter<br>
Keep your eyes focused<br>
He’ll get you out<br>
Don’t you know this<br>
Thinking cloudy<br>
That’s from that smokin<br>
Need to eat<br>
Mind must be starving<br>
Your brain been aching<br>
The stress you hold<br>
When all you need<br>
Is to let him hold it<br>
There’s a God with you<br>
A God within you<br>
I’m no better<br>
I’ve been like you<br>
I am you<br>
So stop the nonsense<br>
Regain your conscience<br>
We have a purpose<br>
It’s true<br>
Three sides to the story<br>
One truth there is<br>
Only one of him<br>
You have his number<br>
You should call him<br>
You got the book<br>
But Tell everybody<br>
Go find the truth<br>
You can do the same<br>
The things I’m saying<br>
You already know this<br>
But you think Im better than you<br>
<br>
